# Epidemic Simulator

Epidemic simulator simulates the spread of a pathogen in a virtual population. The population is based on real-life demographic data and is displayed on a world map. The map consists of various locations, e.g., homes, offices, shops, hospitals, etc. Each individual of the population commutes between various locations based on a randomized pattern that is based on transit statistics.
